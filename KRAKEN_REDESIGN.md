# 🐙 Kraken Redesign - Complete Overhaul

## Summary
Completely redesigned the ASCII kraken from scratch with a much larger, more detailed design featuring **2 eyes** and **long distinct tentacles**!

## New Design Features

### Visual Design
- **2 Eyes**: Both eyes visible (o/O for idle, ^/> for excited, >/< for eating)
- **5 Long Tentacles**: Clearly visible and animated
- **Large Size**: ~29 lines tall, ~19 characters wide (much bigger than the old 9-line design)
- **Detailed Features**: Head with curved top, smiling mouth, long flowing tentacles

### Animation States

#### 1. **Idle** (calm floating)
- **idle1**: Small eyes (o o), gentle smile, tentacles hanging naturally
- **idle2**: Big eyes (O O), same pose, creates a blinking effect
- Alternates between frames for a calm, floating animation

#### 2. **Swimming** (tentacles propelling)
- **swim1**: Eyes focused, tentacles spread wide for propulsion
- **swim2**: Eyes big, tentacles compressed together (power stroke)
- Shows realistic swimming motion with tentacle compression/expansion

#### 3. **Eating** (excited and chomping)
- **eat1**: Excited eyes (^ ^), mouth wide open with WWW teeth, tentacles curled
- **eat2**: Squinting eyes (> <), mouth chomping with VVV teeth, tentacles grabbing
- Fast animation (300ms) shows energetic eating behavior

## Technical Changes

### ascii_pet_designs.py
```python
# OLD (9 lines, single eye)
'idle1': [
    "     .-.-.     ",
    "   __(   )__   ",
    "  /         \\  ",
    "  |    O    |  ",
    ...
]

# NEW (29 lines, dual eyes, long tentacles)
'idle1': [
    "        ___________",
    "      /             \\",
    "     /   o     o     \\",
    "    |                 |",
    "    |    \\___/        |",
    ...
    "    (                )",
]
```

**Added sprites**: `swim1`, `swim2`, `eat1`, `eat2`  
**Updated animations**:
```python
ASCII_ANIMATIONS = {
    'idle': ['idle1', 'idle2'],
    'swimming': ['swim1', 'swim2'],  # NEW
    'eating': ['eat1', 'eat2']       # NEW
}
```

### desktop_pet.py
**State Management**:
- `idle` → when no shrimp targets
- `swimming` → when moving towards shrimp (distance > 5)
- `eating` → when reached shrimp, eating it

**Animation Updates**:
- State-based animation selection
- Faster eating animation (300ms vs 500ms)
- Smooth state transitions

### quick_test.py
- Same state management as main app
- Updated feature descriptions
- Shows all 3 animation states in action

## Sprite Comparison

| Aspect | Old Design | New Design |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| Height | 9 lines | 29 lines |
| Width | ~15 chars | ~19 chars |
| Eyes | 1 eye | 2 eyes |
| Tentacles | 3 short | 5 long, animated |
| States | 2 (idle only) | 6 (idle, swim, eat) |
| Animations | 1 (idle) | 3 (idle, swimming, eating) |

## Behavior Flow

```
IDLE (floating calmly)
  ↓
  [User clicks to drop shrimp]
  ↓
SWIMMING (tentacles propelling toward shrimp)
  ↓
  [Reaches shrimp]
  ↓
EATING (excited eyes, mouth open, chomping!)
  ↓
  [Shrimp consumed]
  ↓
IDLE (returns to calm state)
```

## Character Details

### Eyes
- **Idle**: `o` and `O` (blinking effect)
- **Swimming**: `o` and `O` (focused)
- **Eating**: `^` (excited), `>` `<` (squinting while chomping)

### Mouth
- **Idle**: `\___/` (gentle smile)
- **Swimming**: `\___/` (same)
- **Eating**: `/WWW\` and `|VVV|` (teeth showing, chomping motion)

### Tentacles
- **5 visible tentacles** from the body
- **Long and flowing** (extends 20+ lines below head)
- **Animated**: Spread wide → compressed → spread (swimming)
- **Curved**: Parentheses and slashes create organic movement

## Files Modified
1. **ascii_pet_designs.py**: Complete sprite redesign (6 sprites total)
2. **desktop_pet.py**: Added state transitions for swimming/eating
3. **quick_test.py**: Added state transitions for swimming/eating

## Testing
```bash
# Compile check
python3 -m py_compile desktop_pet.py quick_test.py ascii_pet_designs.py

# Verify sprites loaded
python3 -c "import ascii_pet_designs; print(list(ascii_pet_designs.ASCII_PET_SPRITES.keys()))"

# Preview designs
python3 quick_test.py
```

## Next Steps
The kraken now has:
- ✅ 2 eyes
- ✅ Long distinct tentacles
- ✅ Larger, more detailed ASCII art
- ✅ 3 animation states (idle, swimming, eating)
- ✅ State-based behavior system
- ✅ All features fully functional

Ready to test in the GUI! 🎉
