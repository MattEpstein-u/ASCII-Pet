# Compact Kraken Design

## Overview
This is a **simple, clean octopus/kraken design** based on the user-provided ASCII art. It's much more compact than previous versions while maintaining all the core features.

## Specifications

- **Sprite Height**: 11 lines (reduced from 18)
- **Sprite Width**: ~20 characters
- **Total Sprites**: 8 (idle×2, swim×3, eat×3)
- **Animation States**: 3 (idle, swimming, eating)
- **Mouth Offset**: y=6 (updated from y=7)

## Visual Showcase

### Idle State
```
     ______
    /      \
   /        \
   |        |
)  o        o   (
(    \      /    )
 \___/||||||\___/
 /____/ |||| \____\
,-.___/  ||  \___,-.
/   ___/    \___   \
   _/            \_
```

### Swimming State
```
     ______
    /      \
   /        \
   |        |
)  @        @   (

/____/  ||||  \____\
-.___/   ||   \___,-
  ___/        \___
 _/              \_
```

### Eating State
```
     ______
    /      \
   /        \
   |        |
)  X        X   (
(    \ /VV\ /    )
 \___((||||))___/
 /___((||||))___\
,-.__(( || ))__,-.
/  _((      ))_  \
  ((            ))
```

## Design Features

### Head Structure
- **Rounded dome top**: `______` creates a smooth mantle
- **Side walls**: Clear octopus head shape
- **Simple geometry**: Easy to read and understand

### Eyes & Expressions
- **o** - Calm/resting (idle)
- **O** - Open/alert (idle2, swimming)
- **@** - Very alert (swimming)
- **X** - Excited (eating)
- ***** - Intense (eating)
- **^** - Happy (eating)

### Mouth Variations
- **\\      /** - Calm/closed (idle)
- **\\  __  /** - Neutral (idle2)
- **\\  >   /** - Forward motion (swimming)
- **\\  ^   /** - Upward motion (swimming)
- **\\ /VV\\ /** - Eating/chomping
- **\\ <WW> /** - Wide open
- **\\ /^^\\ /** - Satisfied

### Tentacles
- **||||||** - Main tentacle cluster (6 visible)
- **||||** - Secondary tentacles
- **|| ||** - Spread tentacles
- **(( ))** - Wrapping tentacles (eating animation)

### Animation Effects
The eating animation shows the tentacles **wrapping around prey** using parentheses:
- `\\___((||||))___/` - Tentacles gripping
- `,-.__(( || ))__,-.` - Tight grip
- `((            ))` - Fully wrapped

## Technical Details

### Mouth Targeting
```python
mouth_offset_x = 0  # Centered horizontally
mouth_offset_y = 6  # Line 6 of 11-line sprite
```

The mouth is located at the **bottom of the head** where the tentacles connect (line 6). When the kraken swims to eat a shrimp, the sprite position is calculated so that **line 6 reaches the shrimp location**.

### Compact Benefits
1. **Smaller file size** - Less ASCII art data
2. **Faster rendering** - Fewer lines to draw
3. **Cleaner appearance** - Easier to read at a glance
4. **More screen space** - Takes up less room in the underwater environment

## Comparison with Previous Design

| Feature | Previous (Detailed) | Current (Compact) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Height | 18 lines | 11 lines |
| Width | ~50 characters | ~20 characters |
| Complexity | High detail, realistic | Simple, clean |
| Style | Professional ASCII art | Geometric/minimalist |
| Tentacles | Flowing, organic curves | Straight lines (||) |
| Mouth Offset | y=7 | y=6 |

## Usage

Run the test script to see it in action:
```bash
python3 quick_test.py
```

Or launch the full desktop pet:
```bash
python3 desktop_pet.py
```

## Animation Sequences

### Idle Animation
`idle1` ↔️ `idle2`
- Eyes alternate: o → O
- Mouth changes: calm → neutral

### Swimming Animation  
`swim1` → `swim2` → `swim3` → (repeat)
- Eyes: @ → O → @
- Mouth shows forward/upward motion
- Tentacles shift position

### Eating Animation
`eat1` → `eat2` → `eat3` → (repeat)
- Eyes: X → * → ^
- Mouth: /VV\\ → <WW> → /^^\\ 
- Tentacles wrap with (( ))

## Code Compatibility

✅ **Fully compatible** with:
- `desktop_pet.py` - Updated mouth offset to y=6
- `quick_test.py` - Updated mouth offset to y=6
- `ascii_pet_designs.py` - All 8 sprites redesigned

No other code changes needed!
